# Shell tools

Prefer these over their classic equivalents.

**Browser and frontend:**
- For rendered-page, frontend, or signed-in UI checks, try in order until one works: in-app Browser, Chrome DevTools MCP, repository automation (e.g. Playwright). Before skipping Chrome DevTools, search deferred tools (`ToolSearch` or equivalent) and check the repository for automation.

**GNU vs BSD:** unprefixed CLI tools are BSD on macOS, GNU on Linux. Write scripts to run on both (POSIX, no flavor-specific flags). GNU builds are `g*` (`gsed`, `gdate`, `gtimeout`).

**Text and file navigation:**
- `eza` over `ls`, `bat` over `cat` and `less`
- `fd` over `find` for terse search; `bfs` when `find` syntax is needed
- `rg` over `grep` for code search; `ugrep` for searching inside archives, compressed files, or PDFs
- `rg` recurses by default. Never pass `-r`: it is `--replace` and silently rewrites output. Write `rg -il`, never `rg -ril`.
- A pattern starting with `-` reads as flags; pass it as `grep -F -e '-de-DE' f`. The error goes to
  stderr, so a run discarding stderr and testing only for empty output reads the failure as zero hits.
- `jq`'s `strftime` renders UTC, while `date` renders local time. Bucketing an epoch timestamp
  into a day through `jq` puts everything before local 02:00 on the previous day.
- `rg` skips dot-directories, so `rg <pattern> .` reports zero hits across every skill, rule, agent and memory under `.claude/`. Pass `--hidden`, name the directory, or use `git grep`. A "no references remain" sweep run without it cannot fail.
- `rg` with no path argument searches stdin wherever stdin is a pipe or a file, a tool call included, and hangs until the timeout, leaving an empty result file that reads as zero hits. Pass a path (`.`) and `</dev/null`. It also skips binary files, so count PDFs by file name with `git ls-files` or `fd`.
- `delta` for diffs, `tree` for directory tree, `fzf` for fuzzy selection
- `zoxide` for directory jumping (`z <pattern>`)

**HTTP and data:**
- `xh` over `curl` and `httpie`
- `jaq` over `jq`, `pandoc` for document conversion
- `scrapling` to scrape web pages to markdown (`scrapling extract get <url> out.md`)

**Git and code-host:**
- `gh` for GitHub, `glab` for GitLab
- `lazygit` for git TUI, `git-filter-repo` for history rewrites
- Global git aliases from `~/.gitconfig` that add workflow behavior:
  - `git all <args...>` -> run `git <args...>` in every repository under the current tree
  - `git integrate <branch>` -> merge a branch with `--no-ff --edit` after confirming `HEAD` is up to date with that branch

**System and shell:**
- `btop` over `htop`, `watch` for repeated commands
- `just` as command runner, `parallel` for fan-out
- `cdxe` to start Codex exec. It is aliased to `codex exec --yolo`: no approvals, no sandbox.

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
- `bun` instead of `node` for running scripts
- `bunx` instead of `npx` for one-off package execution
- `bun install -g` for globals at `~/.bun/bin`
- built-in `Bun.Image` for image processing (Sharp-shaped, JPEG/PNG/WebP/HEIC/AVIF, no npm deps)

**Python:**
- `uv` for project envs and dependencies
- `uvx` for running tools without installing
- `pipx` for persistent CLI installs

Environment: macOS (darwin), Homebrew, zsh, Ghostty terminal.

The Bash tool runs zsh. A bare word starting with `=` (`echo =====`) is a failed command lookup that
drops the rest of the command line, and `:r` right after a variable is a modifier (`$sha:refs/...`
loses its `r`). Quote separators and write `${var}:`. An unmatched glob fails its own command with
`no matches found`.
