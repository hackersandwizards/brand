name: schedules
description: Create, change, rename or review a scheduled task (the desktop app's recurring runs under ~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/), deciding first whether it should be a schedule at all. Use for "schedule this", "create a scheduled task", "run this daily/weekly", "change the schedule", "rename the task", "standing approval".

# Schedules

1. Decide whether it needs a schedule. Only work that must notice an absence earns one.
   Deterministic work becomes a gate, and event-driven work becomes an agent the event calls. A run
   a person triggers at your request is your run, so say what it will do in the world when you ask
   for the trigger. Check: you can name the absence the schedule notices.
2. Name a skill for its function and the scheduled task for its job, with the cadence as the last
   segment (`mail-sweep-hourly`). Create the task without a `title`, so the app shows that name.
   A task's identifier is immutable, so a rename is a delete plus a create, and the new
   registration inherits neither its last-run time nor its tool grants, so set the grants again.
   Check: the name ends in the
   cadence.
3. Put the procedure in a skill the task loads, counts included, so every run of a task is
   identical: a count that seems to differ by weekday becomes one number in the skill. The task
   carries only what is true because it runs on a schedule: the cadence, the colleague it delegates
   to, the standing approval and its limit, and the ledger that dedupes across runs. Check: the
   task file holds no step the skill could hold.
4. Write the standing approval as a closed list of the outward acts and their limits, never the
   record writes, which the skill names. Check: every outward act the skill performs is on the list
   or the skill drafts it instead.
5. A run reading a time window starts at the earlier of its default and the start
   `bun ~/.claude/scripts/schedule/last-run.ts <task id>` prints, never at the app's last-run time,
   which also stamps dispatches that never started. Where the script exits non-zero, the run takes
   its default and says so. The run reports how far back it reached. A task whose work belongs to
   its own day or slot says in one line that it does not catch up. Check: the task names its
   window rule or the no-catch-up line.
6. Every run ends its report with its outcome, done, deferred or blocked, and the reason for
   anything but done. Check: the task text demands that line.
7. The model and permission mode live on the registration in the app's `scheduled-tasks.json`, the
   tool grants in the app, never in the task's `SKILL.md`. Set and change them in the app's edit
   form: the app rewrites that file from its own store and has dropped a permission mode edited
   there.
   Check: the task's `SKILL.md` names no model, mode or grant.
