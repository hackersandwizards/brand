# Delegation

## Codex model tiers

Default: whatever `.codex/config.toml` sets, a repository's own before `~/.codex/config.toml`. Each
repository pins its own model and effort for the work it holds. Read the value there.

| Pick | For |
|------|-----|
| the repository's pin | everyday work |
| gpt-6.1-sol high | planning, hard bugs, architecture, final review |

- Sol accepts `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, `ultra`. It has no `none`.
- `codex exec --model` overrides the config per invocation. Heavier one-off work goes there, not
  into the repository's pin.
- `--full-auto` does not exist: the workspace-write auto-review is
  `--approve-for-me`. `codex exec` with an open pipe on stdin waits for EOF before starting, so pass
  `< /dev/null` where stdin might be open.
- `startup_timeout_sec` defaults to 10s, and `.codex/config.toml` sets 60 on the slow-starting
  servers.
- A skill's `agents/openai.yaml` is ungated: bump its `short_description` by hand in the commit that
  adds a mode.

## Human writing -> Claude

Codex hands Claude every piece of authored copy the voice rules cover. An agent's own conversation
with the user (replies, questions, status, explanations, technical answers) it writes itself.

```bash
claude -p "Write the <mail/message>. Facts: sender+signature, recipients, language, purpose, must/must-not facts, new mail or reply. For mails: subject line AND body. Output only the text."
```

Check facts (names, dates, links, recipients, language, signature), content correctness, and
length. Never phrasing or tone. On a finding, call `claude -p` again with the previous text plus
the concrete finding. Deliver the output verbatim: no rewording, no dropped or added sentences, no
re-casing, no polish. Any text change goes through another `claude -p` call.

## Claude -> Codex

Claude starts Codex only for a capability Claude does not have, and never to author text. Image
generation is that capability.

Verify what a run did with `git log`, never from its own summary.
