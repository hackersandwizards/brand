name: blind-review
description: Decide how much review a result a person will see deserves, from none to a large blind panel, and run it blind (personas, criteria, scoring, noise, stop rules, screenshots, the Claude and Codex reviewer commands). Use before handing over or shipping anything a person will read or see: copy, mail, a page, a document, slides, a logo or other brand element, a design variant, a report, and for "blind review", "review this", "panel", "score the variants", "which version is better".

# Blind review

Every result a person will see gets the review it deserves, and you judge how much, none included.
Ask: who is hurt and how much if this is wrong, and how hard is it to take back?

## How much

Examples, not triggers:

- **None:** a thank-you or receipt mail, an internal note.
- **Small:** one persona from the real recipient or audience, Codex, one run.
- **Medium:** 2 to 3 personas, Claude and Codex, the current state scored against the new one.
- **Large:** 4 to 6 personas, both models, two runs, noise measured, an independent counter-draft
  scored alongside.

Cadence: a review per batch; a code, security and simplify review (`/code-review high`,
`/security-review`, `/simplify`, a fresh agent per pass) per milestone and before a repository is
shared.

End your report with your choice in one line: "Review: small, because first contact" or "Review:
none, because receipt".

## Whenever a review runs

1. Before the first draft, or before the first round where a draft exists, fix the medium, the
   audience and the real display size. Check: every reviewer prompt names all three.
2. Take the personas from the real target audience. Fix the criteria before scoring; for visual
   work "breathing room, not cramped" and "visual calm" are criteria of their own. Check: the
   criteria list is written before any score exists.
3. Brief unprimed: each reviewer gets only its role, the artifacts and the same criteria, with no
   score, rationale, hypothesis, preference, or hint of which version is current, new or whose.
   Use neutral labels and a shuffled order per reviewer. Score the unchanged current state
   alongside, where one exists. Quote one reviewer prompt verbatim in the report. Check: no prompt names an author or
   a version's age.
4. Show each visual at its real display size in its real context and at full size. A candidate on a
   third-party surface (a chat app, a phone, a booth wall) goes on a mock first checked against a
   real screenshot of that surface. Downscale a screenshot judged only on layout, content or
   presence to 1000 px on its long side (`sips -Z 1000 in.png --out out.png`); give one judged on
   legibility, typography or logo detail at full size or as a full-resolution crop of that detail.
   An image costs `⌈width / 28⌉ × ⌈height / 28⌉` tokens, up to 4,784 at a 2,576 px long edge.
   Check: every image is at its real display size in context, at 1000 px or at full resolution.
5. For a shared brand element (logo, colour, lockup, frame), compare the whole system across every
   surface before the first surface, and name the combinations you skipped. Check: the report
   lists the surfaces and the skipped combinations.
6. A person's preferred variant is a hypothesis the next round tests blind, never a score.
7. Between rounds, ask every reviewer what keeps each criterion below the maximum, group the reasons
   by element and fix one or two causes. Fix only what a real reader or user would notice.
8. Noise is the score spread between two runs of the same reviewer. A lead inside the noise is a
   tie, and a tie goes to the variant with fewer exceptions. Check: the report gives the noise next
   to the lead, or says it was not measured.
9. Stop on a plateau and report it instead of starting another round. Once a review says ship with
   no must-fix, order no confirming review. For long prose, stop after two consecutive rounds
   without a finding in classes named before round one (contradiction, counts, a statement against
   its fetched source, language parity, a broken sentence); the rest is a list for the author.

## Reviewer commands

Run each reviewer headless and read-only, the prompt as the last argument naming each artifact by
absolute path; Codex takes images with `-i <file>`:

```bash
claude -p --model opus --strict-mcp-config --no-session-persistence --allowedTools=Read "<prompt>"
codex exec -m gpt-6.1-sol -c model_reasoning_effort="high" --skip-git-repo-check --ephemeral -s read-only "<prompt>" < /dev/null
```

Codex reviews; it never authors the text under review.
