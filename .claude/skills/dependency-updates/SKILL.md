# Dependency updates

Work through each repository you are given, one at a time.

1. Raise every external dependency to its newest release, majors included, with the means the
   repository normally uses for that kind: packages and their lockfiles, toolchain pins, container
   and CI images, Terraform providers and modules, and anything else pinned to an outside version.
   Package managers do not report a newer tag of a git dependency (`git+ssh://…#vX`, our own
   `@hackersandwizards/*` included): read the newest tag with `git ls-remote --tags <url>` and raise
   the pin to it. Clear every open security advisory, replacing a dependency no release fixes.
2. Fix what the updates break until the checks the repository's `CLAUDE.md` names are green. Roll
   back only an update you cannot make green.
3. Commit everything as one commit and push it. Nothing changed means no commit.

Report per repository: the commit hash or "nothing to update", and each dependency or advisory left
behind, with the failing check or advisory ID.
